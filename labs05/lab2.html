            <h3>Introduction to HTML Structure</h3>
            <p>
                Hello, this is my first webpage where I learned how to create a website. I have learned how to add links to my webpage and how to properly structure the ol> and li> lists for better display. I also learned about the heading structure, including the use of H1 and H2 tags. This project helped me understand how to create a basic but well-organized webpage.</p>

            <h3>List thing I have learned</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>I learned how to use li> for list items and ol> for creating number lists.</li>
                <li>I also learned how to add links in HTML, which lets me create clickable links to other pages or websites, making the webpage more useful and easier to navigate.</li>
                <li>I also learned how to structure my headings correctly, using H1 for the main title and H2 for subheadings, keeping them in the right order with H1 always following H2.</li>
                <li>The final thing I learned from this lab is how to check and correct errors using a validator.</li>
            </ol>
