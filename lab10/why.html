It will allow people to have a smoother experience through different devices and platforms, making the process feel more natural.</p>
    <p>For the developers, the Web Share API is a time saver and it will make it easier to get to link websites and apps.

Overall, the Web Share API helps websites work better with other apps, improving efficiency and making content sharing faster.</p>
