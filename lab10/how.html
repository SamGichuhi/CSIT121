    <h2>How is it used?</h2>
    <p>How the Web Share API being used is to make it easier for websites to let users share content directly from their devices. For example, blogs and news sites use it so people can quickly share articles on apps like WhatsApp or Twitter without extra steps. Online stores use it to let shoppers share product links, discounts, or wish lists with friends through email or messaging apps. Itâ€™s good for sharing files, like photos or documents, directly from a website. Overall, it makes sharing simple and works with the tools people already use on their phones or computers.</p>
