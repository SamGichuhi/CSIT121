            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Samcollins Gichuhi, but I prefer to be called Sam. I'm in my second year at CCBC. I've always been interested in technology, especially learning how things are made and how to code, which I thought was cool even as a kid. I'm also an active person and enjoy playing sports like basketball and soccer for fun.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                
                I am majoring in Information and technology. I chose CCBC because its two-year transfer programs offer an affordable way to further my education while preparing for a bachelor's degree. I'm also eager to expand my knowledge in IT and related fields as I work towards my associate degree. After completing my two years at CCBC, I plan to transfer to Towson University to continue my studies.

            <p> 
                I have learned that "!DOCTYPE html" is a command that tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is using. I also learned about charset="UTF-8", charset which makes sure the computer can understand the text properly. UTF-8 is a popular system that can handle almost any character from any language. I also learned how to delete folders in GitHub.
