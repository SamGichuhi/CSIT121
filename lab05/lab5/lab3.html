            <h3>Introduction to HTML Structure</h3>
            <p>
                Hello, this is my first webpage where I learned how to create a website. I learned how to add links to my webpage and how to properly structure the <code>ol</code> and <code>li</code> lists for better display. I also learned about the heading structure, including the use of <code>H1</code> and <code>H2</code> tags. This project helped me understand how to create a basic but well-organized webpage.
            </p>

            <h3>Things I Have Learned</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>I learned how to use <code>li</code> for list items and <code>ol</code> for creating numbered lists.</li>
                <li>I also learned how to add links in HTML, which lets me create clickable links to other pages or websites, making the webpage more useful and easier to navigate.</li>
                <li>I learned how to structure my headings correctly, using <code>H1</code> for the main title and <code>H2</code> for subheadings, keeping them in the right order with <code>H1</code> always preceding <code>H2</code>.</li>
                <li>The final thing I learned from this lab is how to check and correct errors using a validator.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Things I have learned lab 3</h3>
            <p>
                In this lab, I learned how CSS improves the look of HTML by making it cleaner and more organized. I discovered how to use ID and class selectors to apply specific styles to different elements, which enhances the overall design. I also found out how to remove the underline from links with CSS, giving the webpage a more polished appearance. This experience helped me understand about style webpages more accurately and pay better attention to detail.
