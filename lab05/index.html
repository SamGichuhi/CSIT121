        <p>HTML is the basic structure used to create web pages. It uses tags like h1 for headings, p> for paragraphs, and a> for links to organize content. Every webpage starts with a html> tag, followed by a head> for meta information and a body> where visible content goes. Learning HTML is essential because it forms the foundation of every webpage.</p>

        <h2>Lab03 Reflection</h2>
        <p>I learned how to use ul> for creating bullet-point lists and ol> for numbered lists. I also learned how to add links in HTML, which allows me to create clickable links to other webpages or websites, making navigation easier and the webpage more functional. I learned to structure my headings properly by using h1> for the main title and h2> for subheadings, keeping them in the correct order with h1> always coming first. Lastly, I discovered how to check and fix errors in my code using a validator to ensure everything works correctly.</p>

Using these tools has improved my ability to build clean, user-friendly designs. With practice, I'm confident i will become become better with layout creating that look good across all screen sizes.</p>
