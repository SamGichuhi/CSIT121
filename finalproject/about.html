        <p>Completing this project had some challenges with it. One of the biggest challenges was understanding how to structure in different styles of HTML and CSS to create a clean and responsive layout. At first, I struggled with making sure everything looked right on different screen sizes, but with testing. I also learned how to use media querie and proper spacing with this project. It was also nice to see the progress I made in designing a functional website that includes all the required elements.</p>
        <p>Testing the website on the browser and the phone browser helped me understand how important compatibility is. I noticed that some features, such as the layout and spacing, appeared differently depending on the browser. This made me pay more attention to the small details and adjust my code to make the website look consistent everywhere. Overall, working on this project gave me more confidence in using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. </p>
        <p>This course has been a great learning experience for me. It showed me how coding and design work together to create websites that are easy to use and look good. I have improved my skills in building webpages and learned how to make them accessible and make it user friendly for everyone to use.</p>
