</ul>

<h2>CRAP Design Principles</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Principles Used: 
        The Naruto Official website uses the Contrast principle from CRAP design. For example, it has a clear difference between the text and background colors, which makes the headings easy to see. This helps users navigate the site better. However, the body text could be easier to read with even more contrast.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Audit Score: 66</li>
    <li>Issues Found:
        <ul>
            <li>Color Contrast: Text color and background color don't contrast enough, making it hard for users with low vision or colorblindness to read.</li>
            <li>Image Descriptions: Many images lack alternative text, which makes them inaccessible to users who rely on screen readers.</li>
            <li>Clear Link Text: Some links aren't clear or descriptive, which can confuse users who need screen readers or have mobility issues.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Site Performance</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Effectiveness: Easy to find content, but visuals may clutter navigation.</li>
    <li>Efficiency: There is a quick access efficiency but can feel busy.</li>
    <li>Engagement: Visually engaging and well-suited to fans, but some accessibility adjustments could improve interaction for all users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Improvements: They need to add better text contrast and image descriptions for accessibility.</li>
</ul>
