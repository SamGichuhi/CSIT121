    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>The hardest part for me was connecting the images and CSS folders to the work folder. I resolved the issue by moving both the CSS and images folders into the work folder and change the code to connect the folders because on github the code wasn't working when they were outside of it. I also struggled with setting the background image properly, since I didn't fully understand how to apply the code correctly. The background wouldn't show up, but after watching YouTube tutorials, I realized my mistake. I needed to add a dot (.) in the path to correctly link the folders, and this fixed the problem. What my problem was I first used /lab4/images/cloud.png and thought it was the right way to link the image, but I later realized I needed to change it.</p>
